## Using the WebApp

You can access the WebApp at: [**Pregnancy Calendar Helper**](https://levymatan.github.io/pregnancyCal/)

The app provides three simple ways to generate a calendar:
1.  **Known Date**: Enter any date along with the corresponding week and day of the pregnancy.
2.  **Last Period**: Enter the date of the last menstrual period.
3.  **Due Date**: Enter the expected due date.

Once the information is entered, the app will display a comprehensive calendar that you can also download as an iCal file to import into your personal calendar application.

## Key Features

*   **Multiple Calculation Methods**: Flexible options to generate the calendar based on what you know.
*   **42-Week Calendar**: Generates a full 42-week calendar to cover the entire possible length of pregnancy.
*   **Due Date Highlight**: Automatically marks the expected due date (end of week 40) on the calendar.
*   **Daily & Weekly Views**: Choose to view events by day or by week.
*   **iCal Export**: Download the calendar events for easy import into other calendar apps like Google Calendar or Apple Calendar.
*   **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern interface that works beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.
